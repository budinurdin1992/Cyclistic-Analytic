3.  Data Preprocessing and Cleaning :
    - Combine Data from multiple dataset.
    - Cleaning data that have Nan Value for column(ride_id, rideable_type, started_at, ended_at, start_lat, start_lng, end_lat, end_lng, member_casual).
    - Cleaning data that have only spaces charcter for column(ride_id, rideable_type, started_at, ended_at, start_lat, start_lng, end_lat, end_lng, member_casual).
    - Cleaning data from Duplicated Value in column(ride_id).
    - Fix columns(started_at, ended_at) data type from String to Datetime.
    - Fix row(ride_id) that has Nan Value or Only Spaces Value for column(start_station_name) if (ride_id) has Value in columns(start_lat, start_lng).
    - Fix row(ride_id) that has Nan Value or Only Spaces Value for column(end_station_name) if (ride_id) has Value in columns(end_lat, end_lng).
    
4. Analysis Methodologi :
